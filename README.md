# PYGB
Repository for the "Pygame-Buddy" handheld gaming console!
The Pygame-Buddy aims at being an educational portable gaming console.
Based on python and pygame, it allows the player (or coder) to enjoy the games created by others, modify them or program brand new games!
A collection of games for the Pygame-Buddy will grow in this other repository: https://github.com/sprintingkiwi/PYGB_GAMES
The whole user interface is made with pygame.
